# Zone-H-Archive-Grabber
A handy script programmed to collect domains from Zone-H.org notifier archive

Limitations:
-----------
1. If domain name is large, it is wrapped as ... at the end like you see in zone-h archive.
2. The collections are looked up in google web cache, so there might be few pages missing some times.
3. Changing the case of letters in the name of notifiers will provide details from more than older days depending on the google cache date however I have added the page cache date in the program for each page lookup.

Maintenance:
-----------
In case you face any more bugs that is not mentioned in the above, you are open to post that issue in the Issues tab that should be seen in this same page! Find this option out!

Note:
----
Do not post unusual texts in the issue page! Else I might take any actions against you(there should be blocking feature I hope, and don't let me look around for that because of you)!
